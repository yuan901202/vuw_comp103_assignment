/** Represents information about an atom in a molecule.
 *  The information includes
 *   - the 3D position of the atom
 *     (relative to the molecule).
 *     x is measured from the left to the right
 *     y is measured from the top to the bottom
 *     z is measured from the front to the back.
 *   - The color the atom should be rendered.
 *   - The radius the atom should be rendered.
 *  The positions come from the molecule file,
 *  the last two values come from the elementTable file.
