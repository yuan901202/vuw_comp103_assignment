/** UndoRecord: Stores information about an action that allows the

 *  The actions are to move a card from a position in the hand onto one of
 *   discard piles. Undoing an action means taking a card off the appropriate
 *   discard pile and putting it back into the hand at the position it used to be.
 *  To do this, the program needs to know:
 *   the position in the hand that the card was taken from, and
 *   the pile the card was put on,
 *  Therefore, each UndoRecord will store a position in the hand, and a pile.
