the
introduction
the
republic
of
plato
is
the
longest
of
his
works
with
the
exception
of
the
laws
and
is
certainly
the
greatest
of
them
there
are
nearer
approaches
to
modern
metaphysics
in
the
philebus

i

very
far
from

you
think
that

may
be

yes

then
after
all
the
just
man
has
turned
out
to
be
a
thief
and
this
is
a
lesson
which
i
suspect
you
must
have
learnt
out
of
homer
for
he
speaking
of
autolycus
the
maternal
grandfather
of
odysseus
who
a
above
affirms
agreed
all
an

and
are

for
for

he
his
homer
however
in
is
is
justice
men
of
of
of
of
perjury
practised
simonides
so
that
that
that
the
the
theft
theft
to
was
was
you
what
you
were
saying
no
certainly
not
that
though
i
do
not
now
know
what
i
did
say
but
i
still
stand
by
the
latter
words
well
there
is
another
question
by
friends
and
enemies
do
we
mean
those
who
are
so
really
or
only
in
seeming
surely
he
said
yes
whom
whom
who
true
to
to
to
to
those
those
thinks
thinks
then
them
the
that
so
seem
persons

not

he
he

good

err
do
conversely
but
be
be
are
and
and
and
about
a
will
be
enemies
and
the
evil
will
be
their
friends
true
and
in
that
case
they
will
be
right
in
doing
good
to
the
evil
and
evil
to
the
good
clearly
but
the
good
are
just
and
would
not
do
an
injustice
true
then
according
to
your
argument
it
is
a
and
better
but
consequence
do
do
doctrine

we
who
who

who
are

in

to
do

to
them
and
he
has
good
enemies
whom
he
ought
to
benefit
but
if
so
we
shall
be
saying
the
very
opposite
of
that
which
we
affirmed
to
be
the
meaning
of
simonides
very
true

we
should
rather
say
that
he

a

who
is
as
well
as

and
that

at

socrates
polemarchus
thrasymachus
he
roared
out
to

what

taken

i
must

i
was
panic

at

in
the
argument
but
i
can
assure
you
that
the
error
was
not
intentional
if
we
were
seeking
for
a
piece
of
gold
you
would
not

that

the

is
that
we

so
you

us

how
characteristic
of
socrates
he

a

he

and
when

the

socrates

the

the

the

we

you

as

yet
one
more
question
does
the

man
try
to

over
the
just
far
otherwise
if
he

he

whether
he
would
or
would
not

i
said
is
not
to
the
point
my
question
is
only
whether
the
just
man
while
refusing
to
have
more
than
another
just
man
would
wish

in
order
that
he
may
have
more
than
all
true
we
may
put
the
matter
thus
i
said
the
just
does
not
desire
more
than
his
like
but
more
than
his
unlike
whereas
the
unjust
desires
more

both

thrasymachus
i

now

you

more

so
whereas
the

yes
but
did
we
not

the

thrasymachus
made
all

with

this
can
no

questioned
by
any

but
i
want
to
view
the
matter
thrasymachus
in
a
different
way
you
would
not
deny
that
a
state
may
be
unjust
and
may
be
unjustly
attempting
to
enslave
other
states
or
may
have
already
enslaved
them
and
may
add
and
and
be

best

whether
which
will

your
the
superior
state
can
exist
or
be
exercised
without
justice
if
you
are
right
in
you
view
and
justice
is
wisdom
then
only
with
justice
but
if
i
am
right
then
without
justice
i
am
delighted
thrasymachus
to

you

whether

a
further

socrates
do

i
should

i

if

is
there
not
also
a

class
of
goods
such
as
knowledge
sight
health
which
are
desirable
not

in
themselves
but
also
for
their
results
certainly
i
said
and
would
you
not
recognize
a

as

also

why
do
you
ask
because
i
want
to
know
in
which
of

you
would
place

in

i

i
know
i
said
that
this
is
their
manner
of
thinking
and
that
this
was
the
thesis
which
thrasymachus
was
maintaining
just
now
when
he
censured
justice
and
praised
injustice
but
i
am
too
stupid
to
be
convinced
by
him
i

if

then
i

the

still
i
acknowledge
that
i
am
perplexed

i

i

said
adeimantus
but
how
does
the

apply
to

enquiry
i
will
tell
you
i
replied
justice
which
is
the

i

there

so
we

infer
that
all

are

the

true
then
carpenters
and

and
many
other

will
be

in
our
little

which
is
already
beginning

then
again
there
is
the
situation
of
the

to
find
a

where
nothing

is
well

then
there

they

that

a

if
i
put
the
matter
in
this
way
you
are

will
break
a
piece
off
in
illustration
of
my
meaning
you
know
the
first
lines
of
the
iliad
in
which
the

says
that
chryses

agamemnon

in
what

he

the

then
he
does
all
that
he
can
to
make
us

that
the

is
not
homer

the

in

no

indeed
he
replied
i
cannot
tell
you
i
only
know
that
there
are
some
three
principles
of
rhythm
out
of
which
metrical
systems
are
framed
just
as
in
sounds
there
are
four
notes
out
of
which
all

are

and
i
think
that
i
have
an
indistinct
recollection
of
his
mentioning
a
complex
cretic
rhythm
also
a
dactylic
or
heroic
and
he
arranged
them
in
some
manner
which
i
do
not
quite
understand
making
the
rhythms
equal

for
i

not

what

that

we

and
so
i
say
to
you
do
not

to

to
the

a

they

we
might

then
as
you

when

of

are
only
seemingly

then

he
is
speaking
of
something
which
is
not

and
therefore
we
must
consider
whether
in
appointing
our

we
would
look
to
their
greatest
happiness
individually

we
impose
upon

the

said

we

yes
he
said
that
is
not
so
difficult
the
regulations

we
are

my
good
adeimantus
are
not

he
said
then
to
sum
up
this
is
the
point
to
which
above
all
the
attention
of
our
rulers
should
be
directed
that
music
and
gymnastic
be
preserved

original

and
no

and
i

further

that

so
of

take

there
is

none
whatever
but
the
question
is
not

when

and
said
let
us
have
a
more
precise
statement
of
terms
lest
we
should
hereafter
fall
out
by
the
way
imagine
the
case
of
a
man
who
is
standing

also
moving
his

his

are
at

in

at
the

and
he
may
say
the

of
anything

revolves
in

his

not

if

then
in

can
they
be

that
is
the
correct
mode
of

he

these
be

to
the

of

and
rejection
certainly
admitting
this
to
be
true
of

generally
let
us
suppose
a

you

that

at

to

a

that
the

this
agrees

we

he
replied
and
may
i
not
observe
with
equal
propriety
that
the
hellenic

is
all

i
agree
he
said
that
our
citizens
should
thus
deal
with
their
hellenic
enemies

with

now

at

you

such
an

have
a

intermediate

and
the

negation
of

yes
between

before
i
proceed
further
i
will
make
a
division
what
division
i
will
begin
by
placing

in
a

by
themselves
they
are
about
all

and
as

then
things

view
we
we
which
which
yes
you
them
and
therefore
the
distinctions
of
fire
colour
and
the
like
which
enable
me
to
discern
the
differences
of
some
things
do
not
apply
to
them
in
speaking
of
a
faculty
i
think
only
of
its
sphere
and
its
result
and
that
which
has
the

the

you

not

has
now
arisen

for
that
purpose
a

will
be

the
question
relates
rather
to
the
greater

of

whether
that

the

only
to

into

of

yes
the

and
so
tyranny
naturally
arises
out

he
said
then
in
order
that
we
may
see
clearly
what
we
are
doing
let
us
imagine
democracy
to
be
divided
as
indeed
it
is
into
three
classes
for
in
the

while
the

speak

the
rest
keep
buzzing

the
bema
and
do
not
suffer
a
word
to
be
said
on
the
other
side
hence
in
democracies
almost
everything
is
managed

the

he

at

they
not

err

for
the

let
us

that
if

it
is

for
this

certainly
he
said
that
is
what
the
approver
of

says
to
him
the
supporter
of

makes
answer
that
he

he
said
that
is
quite
what
the
maintainer
of
justice
say
and
so
from
every
point
of
view
whether
of
pleasure
honour
or

the
approver
of
justice
is

if

he

by

we

if

then
here

three

existing

therefore
he
created
a

which
is
essentially
and
by
nature
one
only
so
we
believe
shall
we
then
speak
of
him
as
the
natural
author
or
maker
of
the

yes
he
replied
inasmuch
as
by
the
natural
process
of

he
is
the

he
said
that
we
may
fairly
designate
him
as
the
imitator
of
that
which
the
others
make

i
said
then
you
call
him
who
is
third
in
the
descent
from

an
imitator
certainly
he
said
and
the

an
imitator
and
therefore

you

that

can
