For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (ie. anything in the first 4 lectures, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

We have learned last week is that about collections, which can be use arraylist to store the information if we want. 
And array list have some features, like no maximum, no initial size and no explicit count.
The difficult way to make assignment like Klondike is put cards into target piles. 
As a result, I need learn more stuff in the Java language.
