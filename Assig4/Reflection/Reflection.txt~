For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Java provides several different implementations of the =Set= type, including =HashSet= and
=TreeSet=.  Why didn't it provide =ArraySet= ?  (After all, it provided the
=ArrayList= implementation of the =List= type!).


Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment we learned how to testing our methods and make arrayset.
There have a problem got stuck on which is how to make arrayset faster, because I quite confused about binary search.

It didn't provide ArraySet because the ArraySet cannot list all items that it contain. The ArraySet not allowed duplicate.

Writing good JUnit tests is just as important as writing high-quality code. A well written JUnit tests can prevent several issues during initial development or later maintenance in Java code.
