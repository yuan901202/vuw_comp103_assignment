For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?

* When you load in the same taxonomy from file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.

----------------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment, I learned how to use tree method which is creates, manipulates and queries data stored in general trees. 

* The tree was displayed differently almost every time, because the root could be has the same order, but the children may different when the program load a file.

* One problem is it not trying to move a node in a way that makes it become a child of one of it's existing descendants. Another is problem is that it duplicate with two child which means that parent is children or could say the children is parent.
