For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Some of the recursive algorithms in this assignment could have been written
just as easily using simple loops.

Which recursive methods could have been easily written with loops?

What are the advantage(s) or disadvantage(s) of using recursive methods 
rather than loops.

Why couldn't the others be easily written with loops?

Many people find recursion hard to understand at first, although it doesn't do
anything different from previous programs - it just involves methods which call
methods.  Why is it tricky?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment, there has one problem stuck me on that is sorting using recursion problem. I found not figure out the method of recursion.

The method of "add" and "remove" can be easily written with loops.

Advantages for recursive methods:
1)Faster than loops.
2)More efficient.
3)Simpler version.

Disadvantages for recursive methods:
1)Not easily understand. The while loop is simplest to understand.
2)Sometime it is not faster than loop. For example, store another stack frame.
3)Even a small mistake can take the whole program failure.
4)The algorithm may require large amounts of memory if the depth of the recursion is very large.

The others cannot be easily written with loops, because the method is the same type of the problems.

Because it is a method calls itself to solve some problem.
