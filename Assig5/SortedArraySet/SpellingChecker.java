/** SpellingChecker checks all the words in a file against a dictionary.
 *  It prints out (one per line) any word in the file that is not in the dictionary.
 *  The program can be very simple - it is OK to just have a main method
 *  that contains all the code, but you can use multiple methods if you want.
 *  
 *  The key requirement is that the dictionary should be read from the
 *  dictionary file into a set.
 *  When reading through the document with spelling errors, the program should
 *  check each each word against the dictionary.
 *  Any word that is not in the dictionary is considered to be an error and
 *  should be printed out.
 *
 *  The program should record and print out the total time taken to read
 *  all the words into the dictionary.
 *  It should also record and print out the total time taken to check all the words.
 *
 *  Note that the dictionary and the file to check are assumed to be all
 *  lowercase, with all punctuation removed.

    // Suggested Design:
    // 
    // 1. create a Set of String to hold the words in the dictionary.
    //    (For your first version, use a HashSet; Then use your ArraySet.)
    //
    // 2. 
    //   read each word in the file "dictionary.txt" (use a Scanner)
    //   and add each word to the dictionary Set.
    //   Note that the dictionary contains just over 200,000 words
    //
    // 3. 
    //   Ask the user (UIFileChooser) for the file to check
    //   open the file in a Scanner.
    //   record the start time
    //   loop through file reading each word.
    //   check if the word is in dictionary set
    //   if not, print out the word.
    //   print out total time taken
